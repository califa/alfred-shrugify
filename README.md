# Shrugify for Alfred

Welcome to Shrugify, your express ticket to Shrug Life.

### Features
- The `shrug` keyword can give you the default shrug (`Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`) or turn any text or emoji into your very own custom shrug (`Â¯\_ðŸ¤¡_/Â¯`, `Â¯\_why would you make this_/Â¯`).
- You can also select any text and press a hotkey to immediately copy the shrugified version (`ctrl+opt+cmd+X`).
- As a bonus, you can get a shrug optimized for _big Slack emoji_ (`ctrl+opt+cmd+Z`). This requires the custom shrug arm emoji to be installed on your Slack workspace. These are available inside the workflow package and in this repo.
